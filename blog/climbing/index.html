  <section class="page-section"><h2 id="france-2022">France, 2022</h2>
<p><img src="/images/DSC05592.jpg" alt="First climbing attempt in France" title="My humbling introduction to bouldering in France">
<em>My first encounter with the vertical world - more humbling than expected!</em></p>
<p>Picture this: late summer in France, 2022. I&rsquo;m traveling with my girlfriend and Félix. Félix mentions this thing called &ldquo;bouldering,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m thinking, <em>How different can it be from anything else I&rsquo;ve done?</em></p>
<p>The climbing gym in France became my first lesson in humility. These weren&rsquo;t just walls, they were <strong>vertical puzzles</strong> that laughed at my attempts to power through them. While I could muscle my way through most physical challenges, climbing demanded something entirely different: precise technique, spatial awareness, and a completely new kind of movement.</p>
<p>I remember staring at what seemed like an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; problem, watching other climbers flow up it like they were defying gravity, then stepping up and&hellip; well, way too hard to me.</p>
<p>The experience was humbling, but oddly satisfying. There&rsquo;s something refreshing about finding a challenge that requires you to completely rewire how you think about movement and problem-solving.</p>
<h2 id="the-casual-phase-back-in-montreal">The Casual Phase: Back in Montreal</h2>
<p>Returning to Montreal, I&rsquo;d occasionally join friends at local climbing gyms. It was fun, sure, but more in the &ldquo;let&rsquo;s try something different&rdquo; category than &ldquo;I need this in my life.&rdquo; I was treating it like any other workout: show up, climb some routes, leave.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t realize was that I was missing a crucial element: the right introduction to what climbing could truly offer. Fear and contact with nature.</p>
<h2 id="the-birthday-gift">The birthday gift</h2>
<p>June 3rd, 2024. My 24th birthday.</p>
<p>My girlfriend had been planning something special, but I had no idea it would completely redirect my relationship with vertical challenges. Her gift? <strong>A top-rope climbing class</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re not familiar with climbing terminology, let me break it down: bouldering (what I&rsquo;d tried in France) happens on shorter walls with thick mats below for protection. Top-rope climbing? That&rsquo;s the real deal: <strong>10+ meters of wall</strong> with a rope system that keeps you safe as you ascend. Lastly, for more experienced climber, lead (or sport) climbing is when you clip the rope into quickdraws as you ascend. Essentially, there are moments where you are above the last bolt, and thus a fall would end in a quite significant fly.</p>
<p>The moment I stepped into that harness and started my first climb, something fundamental shifted.</p>
<h2 id="the-moment-everything-clicked">The Moment Everything Clicked</h2>
<p>15 meters off the ground, your feet are smeared against tiny holds no bigger than coins, your fingertips are gripping edges that seem impossibly small, and yet&hellip; you feel completely in control. This is the feeling that made it click.</p>
<p>Unlike bouldering, where power and dynamic movements often dominate, top-rope climbing is about <strong>endurance, technique, and mental fortitude</strong>. You&rsquo;re not just solving a quick puzzle, you&rsquo;re committing to a vertical (and sometimes even over-hanging) that tests every aspect of your climbing ability.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what made it truly special: sharing this experience with the person I love most. There&rsquo;s something incredibly intimate about trusting someone to belay you (hold your safety rope) while you push your limits on the wall.</p>
<h2 id="it-becoming-a-ritual">It becoming a &ldquo;ritual&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Since that transformative birthday lesson, climbing has evolved from a special occasion activity to an essential part of our daily routine. We&rsquo;ve become regulars at <a href="https://www.allezup.com/">Allez Up Pointe Saint Charles</a>, and when I say regulars, I mean we&rsquo;re there almost every single day.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly: <em>almost every day</em>.</p>
<p>What started as a birthday surprise has become our shared obsession, our daily dose of adventure, and honestly, the best stress reliever after long days immersed in research and academic work. There&rsquo;s something incredibly grounding about focusing entirely on the next hold, the next sequence, the next challenge that requires 100% of your attention.</p>
<p><img src="/images/IMG_4061.jpg" alt="First climbing competition in Nanjing, China" title="Unexpectedly joined a bouldering competition in Nanjing, China. ">
<em>Unexpectedly joined a bouldering competition in Nanjing, China. Our team landed the 3rd place!</em></p>
<h2 id="what-climbing-has-taught-me">What Climbing Has Taught Me</h2>
<p>Climbing has been one of the most profound teachers I&rsquo;ve encountered. Here&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s shown me:</p>
<p><strong>Strength comes in many forms.</strong> Physical power can only take you so far. The strongest climbers aren&rsquo;t necessarily the most muscular, they&rsquo;re very often the ones who understand technique, read routes intelligently, and manage their energy efficiently. Oh also&hellip; the ones who know to breath intelligently.</p>
<p><strong>Problem-solving under pressure.</strong> When you&rsquo;re hanging from small holds with your forearms burning, you learn to think clearly and make decisions quickly. This mental training has surprisingly translated to better focus in my research work.</p>
<p><strong>Trust and communication.</strong> Every climbing session is an exercise in trust-trusting your belayer, trusting your gear, trusting your technique. When your climbing partner is also your life partner, this takes on an even deeper meaning.</p>
<p><strong>The beauty of incremental progress.</strong> In climbing, progress isn&rsquo;t always dramatic. Sometimes it&rsquo;s about holding a challenging position for five seconds longer, or finding a slightly better grip sequence to find a resting position.</p>
<h2 id="the-perfect-partnership">The Perfect Partnership</h2>
<p>Having a climbing partner who&rsquo;s also your life partner creates something special. We celebrate each other&rsquo;s climbs, strategize through challenging routes together, and provide encouragement when one of us is struggling with a particularly tricky problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also something beautifully equalizing about climbing—technique often trumps raw strength, which means we can work on similar grade routes and challenge each other in different ways. Some routes favor my reach and power, others favor her technique and flexibility. We&rsquo;re constantly learning from each other.
<img src="/images/IMG_3460.jpg" alt="Climbing in the trees" title="My girlfriend and I on the highest tree-climbing route of Quebec!">
<em>My girlfriend and I on the highest tree-climbing route of Quebec: 30 meters above the ground!</em></p>
<h2 id="looking-up-whats-next">Looking Up: What&rsquo;s Next</h2>
<p>As I write this, we&rsquo;re working our way through more challenging grades and even exploring different climbing disciplines. We&rsquo;ve started dabbling in lead climbing (where you clip your own protection as you ascend, significantly more mental challenge), and we&rsquo;re already planning outdoor climbing trips for next summer.</p>
<p><em>Next time someone invites you to try something completely outside your comfort zone, say yes. You never know which birthday gift might change everything.</em></p>
